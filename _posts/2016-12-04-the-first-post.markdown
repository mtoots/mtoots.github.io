## The very first entry

I had thoughts about starting my own blog for a while. 
I have felt the need to have a representation of myself available online that would showcase my best work as a portfolio and also serve as a medium for self-expression. 
Finally, maybe someone might some day find some of it actually useful or relevant to whatever they are doing.

I have some experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript from around 7 years ago. 
In the mean time, I must say, things have changed indeed. 
I thought setting up my own blog would be a piece of cake, and it was, but a very large and chewy one. 
Although enjoyable, the process of setting everything up and getting things going has taken a while.
