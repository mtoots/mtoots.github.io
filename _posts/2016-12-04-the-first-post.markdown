## The very first entry

I have had thoughts about starting my own blog for a while now. 
I have felt the need to have a representation of myself available online that would showcase some of my work as a kind of portfolio and serve as a medium for self-expression.
Finally, maybe someone might some day find some of it actually useful or relevant to whatever they are doing.

I have some experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript from around 7 years ago. 
In the mean time, I must say, things have changed indeed. 
I thought setting up my own blog would be a piece of cake, and it was, but a very large and chewy one. 
Although enjoyable, the process of getting things going has taken a while.

#### The blog engine

Jekyll became my blog content generator.
