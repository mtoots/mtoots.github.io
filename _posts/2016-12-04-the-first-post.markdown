## The very first post

I have had thoughts about starting my own blog for a while now. 
The main reason is to have some sort of representation of myself available online that is completely under my control. 
The initial intention is that it will showcase some of my work and perhaps function as a kind of portfolio, but who knows where it will develop (if anywhere at all).
Finally, maybe someone might some day find some of it actually useful or relevant to whatever they are doing.

It took me a decent number of evenings to get this site up and running.
Most of the time, to be honest, was spent choosing a nice looking theme and tweaking the styling.
I thought setting up my own blog would be a piece of cake, and it was, but a very large one. 
I have some experience from awhile ago on developing HTML, CSS and Javascript, but technologies come and go and evolve.
Setting up the blog has mostly been an enjoyable process and I have definitely learned a great deal about the modern web technologies. 
It's always fun to learn new things.
