# [MT Blog](https://mtoots.github.io)

Blog about data, science and data science. I'm pretty handy with `R` but would love to learn more of `D3` to complement with interactivity. So this blog is about my explorations in the world of data using both. 

Blog created with Jekyll, theme named Mickey and slightly modified.
